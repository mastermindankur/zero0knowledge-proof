This is a demo to show How can you prove your age to facebook that you are above 14 without revelaing your exact age.

Consider the scenario Yoshika who is ‘n’ years old needs to prove to facebook she is atleast ‘m’ years old.
Yoshika age is ‘n’ and need to prove to facebook that her age is  atleast ‘m’, Yoshika sends sends the “Verified age” and trusted party sends the “Proof” to Facebook. Facebook start applying hash chaining with “Proof” ‘m’ times and check the result match with the “Verified age”. If two values are same, the Facebook can let Yoshika use facebook services. If two values are different, then Facebook can assume child’s statement was false.   

VerifiedAge=Hash (n times) (seed_value) #Generated by Yoshika

Proof = Hash (n-mtimes) (seed_value) #Generated by Trusted Party

VerifiedEdge == Hash (m times) (seed_value) #Generated by Facebook to verify Yoshika's age

![Flowchart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mastermindankur/zero0knowledge-proof/master/Picture3.png)

n = age of child

m = age to prove

x = seed generated by trusted party

Proof P is generated by Trusted party

Verified age V is generated by Yoshika

m times Hash is generated by Facebook to check if age is atleast m or not.
